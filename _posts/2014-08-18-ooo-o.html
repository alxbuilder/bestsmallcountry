Mr Mel McWeeney
Dublin Road
Co Longford

Dear Mr McWeeney
</div>

<p>
I refer to your <a href="/blog/2014/07/02/ooo-o.html" >previous correspondence</a> 
in connection with your appeal of 
<a href="/blog/2014/02/25/ooo-i.html" > this Office's decision</a> 
not to uphold your complaint against Longford County Council.
</p>

<p>
In line with the Office's appeals procedure, I have asked Mr. Sean Garvey, 
Senior Investigator, to examine your appeal.
It is expected that your appeal will be completed within 4-6 weeks.
</p>

<p>
If it appears, however, that the appeal will take longer than expected, 
Mr. Garvey will advise you accordingly.
</p>
