<p><b><u><center>Re: Freedom of Information 
Request 13/14</center></u></b></p>

<p><b>Dear Mr. McWeeney</p></b>

<p>I wish to acknowledge receipt of your Freedom of Information request
on 8<sup>th</sup> July 2013  seeking records that may be held
by Longford Sports and Leisure Centre in relation to your personal
information.</p>

<p>A decision on your request will normally be sent to you within
4 weeks (20 working days) of receipt of your request which means that
you can expect to receive your decision by 2<sup>nd</sup> August 2013.
</p>

<p>If you have not received your decision on the expiry of the
allotted time you are entitled to appeal to Longford County Council for
a review of the matter based on the premise that the initial request is 
considered to be refused once the specified time for responding to it 
has expired.  
The review will be a new examination of the matter 
carried out by a more senior member of staff of the Council.
In the event that you need to make such an appeal you can do so in
writing within 4 weeks (after the date given for the initial decision) 
to the 
<a title="Nice title, so who is this?">Senior Executive Officer</a>,
Gt, Water St., Longford.
You should state that you are appealinhg because an initial decision
was not received by you within the time permitted.
</p>
