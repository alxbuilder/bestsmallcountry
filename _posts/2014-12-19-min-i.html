<br /><br />
<p>Dear James,</p>

<p>I refer to your representations on behalf of the above named, in connection
with a complaint relating to the conduct of a member or members of the Garda
Siochana.</p>

<p>I have established a mechanism, following a Government decision, for the
independent review by councel of certain allegations of Garda misconduct, or
inadequacies in the investigation of certain allegations, which have been made
to myself or to the Taoiseach, with a view to determining to what extent and
in what manner further action may be required in each case.  The review of each
case consists of an examination of the papers in the complaint by a councel
from the panel.  Councel will make a recommendation to me on what action,
if any, might be appropriate.</p>

<p>I wish to advise that this complaint has been included amongst those being
reviewed under the mechanism and that a notification to that effect has been
issued to the complainant.  In relation to the complainant's request for a
meeting, I regret that in these circumstances, pending a recommendation from
the Councel it would not be appropriate for me to meet with him.  Once
councel has reviewed the case and I have considered councel's recommendations,
the complainant will be advised accordingly.
</p>

Yours sincerely,
