<h1>ODPC - Ombudsman investigation or examinations excempt</h1>
<div class="ref">

Dear Mr McWeeney

</div>


<p>
I refer to 
<a href="/blog/2014/04/28/dpc-o.html">your recent email</a> to this Office.
</p>

<p>A very small number of agencies are not required to deal with access
requests under the Data Protection Acts. The Office of the Ombudsman is one
of those organisations. While we do not have sight of the response that you
have received from The Office of the Ombudsman, there is a legal basis
which provides that they do not have to provide access to information which
they have obtained in the course of an investigation or examination.</p>

<p>Accordingly it would appear that this Office is not in a position to
investigate this matter on your behalf.</p>

Yours sincerely


Stewart Fennell,
Office of the Data Protection Commissioner,
