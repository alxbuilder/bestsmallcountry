Our Reference: L30/13/1493

Dear Mr McWeeney

</div>

<p>I refer to your 
<a href="/blog/2013/10/26/ooo-o.html" > recent letter to this Office</a>
in connection with Longford County Council 
about the Council's failure to respond to 
<a href="/blog/2013/03/28/lcc-o.html" > your correspondence</a> 
issued in March 2013.
I understand you have recently received a 
<a href="/blog/2013/04/11/lcc-i.html" > letter from Longford County Council</a>
(Director of Services) setting out the Council position
with regard to your substantive complaint.
</p>

<p>
As discussed during our recent telephone conversation,
you will need to write to the Ombudsman again
setting out what aspects of the Council's response
you are dissatisfied with
and what you would like the Council to do 
in order to remedy your complaint.
</p>

<p>In the meantime, I will be closing your case.</p>
